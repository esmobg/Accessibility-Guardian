Check your site against WCAG 2.2 AA with axe-core, right in wp-admin. Get a score, prioritized issues, fix guidance and optional auto-fixes.

== Description ==

Accessibility Guardian checks your WordPress site against **WCAG 2.2 Level A and AA** from the admin dashboard. It runs the widely used [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) engine in your browser against the fully rendered front end of each page, so it sees what visitors see: computed colour contrast, ARIA, headings, landmarks, form labels, images, links and more.

No external service, no account, no Node.js or headless browser on the server. If your site runs WordPress, it can be scanned.

= What you get =

* **Full-site or single-page scans.** Posts, pages, public custom post types (including WooCommerce products) and, optionally, category and tag archives. Start a single-page scan from the "Scan accessibility" link in the toolbar while viewing any published page.
* **Real rendered-page analysis** with axe-core 4.10 plus extra checks for generic link text ("click here"), placeholder-only form fields, links that open new windows without warning, and linked PDF documents.
* **Best-practice checks** (optional, on by default) for headings, landmarks and page structure. They are reported as warnings because they are not strict WCAG failures.
* **Clear, actionable issues.** Every finding has a severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Warning), the WCAG success criterion, the affected page, the element and its HTML, a recommended fix and a link to documentation.
* **An accessibility score** from 0 to 100 for every scan, with Excellent, Good, Needs Improvement and Poor bands, and a progress-over-time chart.
* **Dashboard** with issues by severity, WCAG category distribution, the most common problems and recent scans.
* **Optional automatic fixes** you can switch on one by one: skip link, visible keyboard focus, underlined content links, a language attribute, new-window warnings, zoom-friendly viewport, removal of positive tabindex and redundant title attributes, and search-form labels.
* **CSV and JSON export** of every scan for your team, agency or audit records.
* **Works on single sites and multisite networks**, including network activation.

= What automated testing can and cannot do =

Automated tools, including this one, find a meaningful share of accessibility problems, but not all of them. Many WCAG requirements (meaningful alternative text, logical reading order, captions, keyboard-only workflows, plain language) still need a human review. Accessibility Guardian helps you find and fix issues faster; it does not certify that a site is accessible or legally compliant with the ADA, the European Accessibility Act, EN 301 549 or Section 508.

= Privacy =

* Scans run on your own site and in your own browser. Page content and results are never sent to the plugin author or any third party.
* Results are stored in your WordPress database and removed when you delete the plugin.
* The issues list links to rule documentation on dequeuniversity.com and w3.org. Those sites are only contacted if you click a link.
* While scanning, pages are loaded in a hidden frame as the logged-in administrator. Analytics or ads on your site may count those page views, just as they would if you opened the pages yourself.
* Automatic fixes only change your site's front end, and only the ones you enable.

= Third-party library =

This plugin bundles [axe-core 4.10.2](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/tree/v4.10.2) by Deque Systems, licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, which is compatible with the GPL. The minified file is `assets/js/axe.min.js`; the unminified source is included as `assets/js/axe.js`.

= For developers =

Filters and actions let you change the scan queue, the axe-core options, the required capability and more. See the [developer documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/esmobg/Accessibility-Guardian#developer-hooks).

== Installation ==

1. In your dashboard go to **Plugins > Add New Plugin**, search for "Accessibility Guardian", then click **Install Now** and **Activate**.
2. Open **Accessibility Guardian > Run Scan** and click **Start full site scan**. Keep the tab open until the scan finishes; you can cancel at any time.
3. Review the results under **Accessibility Guardian > Issues** and the **Dashboard**.
4. Optionally choose which content to scan and enable automatic fixes under **Accessibility Guardian > Settings**.

To install manually, upload the `accessibility-guardian` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` and activate it on the Plugins screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this make my site compliant with the ADA or the European Accessibility Act? =

No tool can do that on its own. Automated checks catch many common problems quickly, but some WCAG requirements can only be verified by a person. Use the report to fix what is found, then test key pages with a keyboard and a screen reader.

= Does scanning need anything installed on the server? =

No. The scan runs in the administrator's browser using a hidden frame on your own site, so standard WordPress hosting is all you need.

= Why must I keep the tab open during a scan? =

The axe-core engine runs in your browser, one page at a time. If you close the tab, the scan stops; the next scan you start marks the unfinished one as failed.

= A page could not be scanned. Why? =

The scan frame must be allowed to load your own pages. Security headers such as `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` block this. `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` and `frame-ancestors 'self'` work. A very strict `script-src` policy can also stop the scanner from loading axe-core in the frame. Other pages in the scan continue normally.

= Will the WordPress toolbar show up in my results? =

No. Pages are scanned as the logged-in administrator, so the toolbar is present, but it is excluded from all checks.

= Which standards are covered? =

WCAG 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 at Level A and AA (choose A or AA in Settings), plus optional axe-core best practices. Each issue shows the related WCAG success criterion.

= How is the score calculated? =

Each scanned page starts at 100 and loses points per issue: Critical 10, Major 5, Minor 2, Warning 1, never going below 0. The site score is the average of all scanned pages, so a few problem pages do not hide an otherwise good site.

= How many pages can a full-site scan cover? =

Up to 1,000 URLs by default: the home page, then published content in ID order. Developers can raise or lower the limit with the `accg_scan_url_limit` filter.

= Are the automatic fixes safe? =

Each fix is off by default and changes only one thing, using WordPress hooks rather than editing your theme. Turn on one fix at a time and check your site afterwards. Fixing problems in your content and theme is always the best long-term solution.

= Does it work with multisite? =

Yes. Activate it on individual sites or network-activate it. Each site keeps its own settings and results, and deleting the plugin removes the data from every site.

= Where is the axe-core source code? =

The unminified axe-core 4.10.2 source is included as `assets/js/axe.js`. The project is maintained at https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core (tag v4.10.2).
